### Fast Turing machine visualizer

[Link](https://fiery.pages.dev/turing/)

This Turing machine visualizer:
* Accepts Turing machines in standard format, the same format as used by https://bbchallenge.org/, along with an editable transition table
* Can animate and show the evolution of a Turing machine up to billions of steps
* Achieves a Turing machine simulation rate of about 100M steps per second on my machine, using pure Typescript.
* Achieves a rendering time of between 10 and 20 nanoseconds per pixel on my machine, using HTML5 Canvas's 2D rendering context.
